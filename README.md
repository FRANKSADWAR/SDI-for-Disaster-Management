# SDI-for-Disaster-Management
Spatial data is at the center of responding to disaster. Organizations dealing with disaster management on the other hand operate in separetly and hardly share their datasets.
This leads to lack of coordination, duplication of data collection efforts which in turn leads to higher costs in data collection.
To tackle this issue, a spatial data infrastructure approach has been adopted, using the open-source GeoNode. 
Steps for setting up GeoNode are available at https://docs.geonode.org/en/master/
